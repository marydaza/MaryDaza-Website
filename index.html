        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Mary Daza. I am a second year student at the University of California, Riverside and I am working on getting my Bachelors of Science in Biology. My love for exploring nature and interacting with organisms sprouted from when I was younger. I grew up in the countryside of the Philippines and everyday was an adventure to learn and connect with my surroundings. As I grew older, I became more interested and more invested with learning about the diversity and complexity that is instilled everywhere there is life. Because of this, I decided to choose Biology as my major and possibly focus on evolution and ecology.<br><br>

        In high school I decided to join as many clubs as I could in hopes of finding something that I will like. At the end of freshman year, I have found that doing community service is what I enjoy the most after many months seeing what fits me best. I became a dedicated member of Key Club, which provided members many opportunities to do community service. Being a member for four years, I helped clean up parks and beaches, planted trees, raise funds for many charities, help the elders, and tutor children to name a few. I also joined the Red Cross to help arrange blood drives, CPR classes, and be advocate for health. I also participated in JOY Club, which helps those with disabilities get the help they need. In my last two years, I spent a great amount of time being an afterschool tutor at the nearby junior high school. For about ten hours a week, I tutored as many as fifty students. Besides doing community service, I was also part of an award winning show choir for three years. After being in it for a year, I became a dance section leader. I was in charge of making sure that everyone knows their choreography and I help sectionals to help improve the dancing aspect of the choir as a whole.<br><br>

        Upon entering college, I knew that I wanted to continue giving back to the community. I decided to join the Red Cross, to gain more knowledge and more experience with preventing and helping alleviate human suffering where it may be found. Also, I joined Healthy Hearts to help educate my peers and the community the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Recently, I have dedicated my time with the Student Homeless Aid Relief Project to provide for the needs of the homeless people in the community. Our mission is to give the homeless basic necessities such as clothing, food, and hygiene products. In spite of all of this, it is my intention to continue learning about evolution and ecology. In the future, I want a career that involves both community service and science. This is why I decided to pursue medicine and become a physician. Becoming a physician involves learning biology, anatomy, ecology and how living and nonliving interact and are affected by one another. At the same time, this career would allow me to give back to the community, which is what my passion is.
